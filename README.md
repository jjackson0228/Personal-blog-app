# Personal Blog

Create a personal blog. When the blog is submitted it redirects you to the next page where the blog title, content, and author shows up. A header or title is also on top of each of the blog post.

#### How to use App

Created a personal blog application where you can sign in with a username, blog title, and blog content. When the form is submitted the data is saved in local storage. After clicking submit it will redirect you to the blog page where it will retrieve the post from a LocalStorage. The post will show the title with a line under the title and a author which will be the username you put in. The blog content will be in list form so there will be a bullet point at the start of your blog content. Once you are done hit the back button in the top right corner of the page. This button will take you back to blog page and make a new blog post. You can look at the right-click and inspect page to see it keeps track of all posts and arrays of who posted, what they posted and the title of post. Light and dark mode works for both pages just click the sun icon in the upper right hand of the screen next to back button. Don't forget in the footer there is a link to my Project Profile.
